# Personal Portfolio Website
Portfolio Showcase Website using React, Webpack and Babel. This Website could also be made with pure HTML and CSS, but I choose to build it with React to get familiar with certain tools and workflows.
## Preview website
After downloading the source files or cloning the repo, to open the Website on your device, open a terminal in the project's folder, install needed node packages, and run the "webpack serve" script:
#### `npm install`
#### `npm run dev`
