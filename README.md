# Personal Portfolio Website
Portfolio Showcase Website using React, Webpack and Babel. This Website could also be made with pure HTML and CSS, but I choose to build it with React to get familiar with certain tools and workflows.
## Preview website
You can see the current state of the website here https://stephpp.github.io/Steph/

Alternatively, you can download the source files or clone the repo, and then open the Website on your device by openning a terminal in the project's folder and:

install needed node packages: 


`npm install`

run the "webpack serve" script: 

`npm run dev`
